# VDMUFusion

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This package contains the source code which is associated with the following paper:

Yu Shi, Yu Liu, Juan Cheng, Z. Jane. Wang, Xun Chen, "VDMUFusion: A Versatile Diffusion Model-Based Unsupervised Framework for Image Fusion", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2024. (under review, second round)

Edited by Yu Shi.   

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

The VDMUFusion model is learned by pytorch. This package contains our pre-trained models and code, which you can use directly for testing. However, if you wish to retrain the models, you will need to download the datasets for multiple image fusion tasks and place them in the corresponding file paths.

Thank you.
